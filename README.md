# ShareRenamer
## A simple and fast share link renamer add-in for the Files app in Nextcloud

![](screenshots/sharerenamer.png)

This is an add-in to the Files app, which allows you to customize your share tokens, so your links can be https://mycloud.de/s/mysharedlink instead of https://mycloud.de/s/qPv1SwbU5M2YEoJZ. Just share a file or folder (or click an already shared one) and a new button will appear below the 'Copy URL' button in the menu of the share.

The translations are from the Files app too, so this app is translated to every language the Files app is translated to.

### Requirements
* Nextcloud >= 9
