# ShareRenamer
## A simple and fast share link renamer add-in for the Files app in Nextcloud

![](screenshots/sharerenamer.png)

This is an add-in to the Files app, which allows you to customize your share tokens, so your links can be https://mycloud.de/s/mysharedlink instead of https://mycloud.de/s/qPv1SwbU5M2YEoJZ. Just share a file or folder (or click an already shared one) and a new button will appear below the share link URL in the sidebar of the Files app.

### Requirements
* Nextcloud >= 9
